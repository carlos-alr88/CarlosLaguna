Completing the Online Masters in Computer Science at The Gorgia Institue of Techology was one of the most rewarding experiences in my academic preparation as a Computer Scientist and Software Engineer.

My journey started back in 2015 when I read about the new Online program launched by one of the most prestigious universities in the United States for around 7,000 dollars.  The price tag and the university reputation grabbed my attention immediately and I felt I had to take that opportunity to advance my career.  

I delayed my application to Fall 2016 of two reasons:
  - The number of courses was limited.
  - I thought the very first generation will unveil areas where the program can be improved. 

The application process is straight forward for applicants with a Computer Science background and it is more difficult for people who are transitioning from other careers.  
The application requirements are:
  - TOEFL test
  - Statement of Purpose
  - Resume
  - Application fee
  - Academic recommendations 

The graduation requirements are very simple, the graduation candidate needs to finish 10 classes with minimum grade of B. There is no Thesis option or requirement.
